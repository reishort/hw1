    <p>This site was designed and published as part of the COMP
        333 Software Engineering class at Wesleyan University. The described platform is not publicly
        available but rather is created as a training exercise.

            This is a website and mobile app <i>for music lovers made by music lovers</i>.
            <b>Rank the Tunes</b> is a place where you have the ability to rank songs and share 
            these rankings with others. It is more than just a song ranking platform, it's a community 
            where music lovers can come together and share their love for music in a new and exciting 
            way. We hope you enjoy the amazing experience we've created for all music lovers to come 
            together and celebrate their love for music in a tantalizing, new way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The founder of this site is a student at Wesleyan University and will be using it as a way
            to put into practice the skills and lessons learned in Comp 333, Software Engineering. This 
            app and website will serve as a good example of the skills she is acquiring in this class. 
            I hope you enjoy the site and are able to use it despite its limited functionality.

        <p> Once we move in the more final steps of our project, this is where the rankings that are 
            generated by our users, more accurately our community, will be. An early example of what 
            this may look like is below, but don't worry by the time the site is fully complete, it will
            look a lot cleaner and be a more fulfilling visual experience for our users. This is just 
            to set the scene for what is to come.

            highly informative, beautiful graphics. This app is definitely worth it. It is a great app 
            and has even more potential. I love the community surrounding this app."

            <p>"This app is just letterbox for music. It functions almost identically and is, like 
            letterbox, a great way to see what is what. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to 
            discover new music or has some interesting takes on music. This is also a great way to
            engage in capitivating conversation about music."</p>

            <h4>Abby W. - 4.67/5.00</h4>
            <p>"As a frequent user of Letterboxd, I was very intrigued by this app. I have used RateYourMusic 
            regularly, but with no app and horrible UI/UX, I would rarely return. Musicboard is a 
            fantastic start, and if they continue to improve the app, it will be as popular as Letterboxd.
            It is a great app. Download it. Also, add some sort of subscription. I would happily pay $2-$3 
            a month for this app just to support its further development."
