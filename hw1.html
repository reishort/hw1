            This is a website and mobile app for <i>for music lovers made by music lovers</i>.
            <b>Rank the Tunes</b> is a place where you have the ability to rank songs and share 
            these rankings with others. It is more than just a song ranking platform, it's a community 
            where music lovers can come together and share their love for music in a new and exciting 
            way. We hope you enjoy the amazing experience we've created for all music lovers to come 
            together and celebrate their love for music in a tantalizing, new way.

            The founder of this site is a student at Wesleyan University and will be using it as a way
            to put into practice the skills and lessons learned in Comp 333, Software Engineering. This 
            app and website will serve as a good example of the skills she is acquiring in this class. 
            I hope you enjoy the site and are able to use it despite its limited functionality.

        <h4>This is where the rankings will live on this site.</h4>
        <p> Once we move in the more final steps of our project, this is where the rankings that are 
            generated by our users, more accurately our community, will be. An early example of what 
            this may look like is below, but don't worry by the time the site is fully complete, it will
            look a lot cleaner and be a more fulfilling visual experience for our users. This is just 
            to set the scene for what is to come.
